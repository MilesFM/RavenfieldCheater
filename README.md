# RavenfieldCheater
A client that changes the Ravenfield source code with a press of a button to allow easy cheating in Ravenfield. This means it works with ANY version of Ravenfield and modders won't have to re-program the mod for each Ravenfield version. It allows multiple cheats to be used at once (instead of manually combining cheats or waiting for a modder to do it for you). It requires no programming skills to use. It uses Mono.Cecil for the injecting/changing code. The project is still in beta and is unofficial. It is also Windows only but a Mac and Linux port should be released after v1.0.
